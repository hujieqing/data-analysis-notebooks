    "1. In order to experiment with different models and variantions, we should define what's the overall process\n",
    "2. For this project, we focus on the following meta steps which can be flexiably replaced with different concrete variations of models\n",
    "    * Divide data into trainingAndValidation and test via the same seed so that results are comparable across different       models\n",
    "    * Dataframe level preprocessing: adding new columns, apply udfs, drop rows, drop columns and etc.\n",
    "    * Apply necessary feature transformation (standardization, PCA, remove outliers or etc)\n",
    "    * Actual model to be used \n",
    "    * Prepare CV data for hyper parameter tuning\n",
    "    * Use the best model on test data and create final summary \n",
    "3. Note that, since we focused on two very different genres of models: linear regression v.s. Tree Basd Regressor. So we keep the evaluation in a free format instead of specific type. For example, $R^2$ should not be used for non linear models\n",

    "1. Boilerplates setting up: here we set up the common code shared by multiple tasks\n",
    "2. Models: \n",
    "    * For each model we need to impelement the two **high level** functions: model_func and evaluate_func which contain the detiled logics of training and evaluation. Also an optional function df_func can be provided to do preprocessing before training or evaluation\n",
    "    * For each model, we will give a very brief summary of our observation\n",
    "3. Comparison: we should include a short summary of the performances for different models\n",
    "4. Appendix script for analysis and exploration: here we can add some additional results of data visulization and analysis."
